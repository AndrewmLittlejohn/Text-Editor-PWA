#Challenge No. 19 - PWA Text Editor


I'm really like learning the steps of fully deploying things, still don't love Heroku but since we didn't have to work with SQL I was better off!

## Things to learn

1. I haven't gotten the install button to work, I will continue to work on this but at this point I'm at a loss, I've used code that multiple times doesn't give me an error but I can't get it open and pop out like it is supposed to do. 

## Lessons Learned

1. I'm finally getting a bit of the hang of Heroku

2. I know there is a way to get your gitHub and Heroku setup so that everytime a change is made I don't have
to do the delete dist, npm run build, and then get everything back to git and Heroku. I wish I had looked into this, would have saved some time.
